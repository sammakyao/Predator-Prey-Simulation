Q1. What outcomes and patterns do you observe in your simulation?
A1. Compared to my last simulation, I love this more and I have seen a similar pattern, the only difference now is
   some animals are killed.

Q2. How does adding the special component affect the behavior of your simulation?
A2. It replicates the real world where predators eat prey and prey eat grass, which my last simulation did not have.

Q3. What aspects seem to be the most realistic?
A3. The aspect of prey eating grass, this is realistic because both animals have something to feed from, i.e. predators
    with prey and prey with grass.

Q4. What are the main shortcomings of your simulation?
A4. As of now, I do not see any huge shortcomings, I am satisfied with the simulation.

Q5. Given more time (and/or knowledge and/or resources), how could you improve your simulation?
A5. I would try to implement the optional parts of the assignment and see how that would look like.
